# Ahoi Plugin for Kirby

A Kirby plugin, that is build to use the Kirby CMS as a data backend for Vue.js or any other webservice. The plugin works together with the [Ahoi Plugin for Vue.js](https://github.com/tritrics/ahoi-vue).

This is pre-release for test purposes. Documentation is coming later.

**The interface is likely to change until final release!**
